The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

This also helps portable devices to save battery.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Speeds up your browser and minimize the memory usage: Inactive, idle or forgotten tabs can be auto-discarded after a configurable period of time or be discarded manually from the toolbar popup.\n2. Tabs (Sites) can be whitelisted to prevent discarding.\n3. Discarded tabs are retained after closing and reopening browser (using your browser's session restore functionality)\n4. Tab's favicon displays the discarded state (If the icon has opacity it is discarded)\n5. Tabs are being restored with all information kept intact (like scroll position or the content of text boxes) when it becomes visible again\n6. When a tab is discarded, no JavaScript code or dom event is active. Basically, the tab is paused.\n\nOptions: There are a few options to customize when a tab gets discarded:\n1. Pinned tabs\n2. When there is a media source playing inside a tab\n3. When the computer is connected to a power source\n4. When there is a form element (with changes) that has not yet been submitted.\n\nExtension Preview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ityhxUPp3y8","weeklyDownloads":1708,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Richard Neomy","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13207224/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/201/201762.png?modified=1543521027","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/201/201762.png?modified=1543521027","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/194/194635.png?modified=1543521028","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/194/194635.png?modified=1543521028","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/addondonation/10usd","averageRating":4.3723,"reviewCount":94,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-tab-discard/reviews/","updateDate":1562546760000},{"id":"default-bookmark-folder@gustiaux.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/870/870031-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/870/870031-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/870/870031-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Default Bookmark Folder","version":"2.10.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3297533/default_bookmark_folder-2.10.1-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/teddy-gustiaux/default-bookmark-folder","supportURL":"https://github.com/teddy-gustiaux/default-bookmark-folder","description":"Allows you to choose the default bookmark location folder and quickly bookmark pages via a dedicated icon.","fullDescription":"Allows you to choose the default bookmark location folder and quickly bookmark pages via a dedicated icon.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nFirefox built-in bookmarking:\n\nThis feature only affects bookmarks added through the built-in Firefox bookmark icon or shortcut (Ctrl+D), through the context menu or via the bookmarks menu.\n\nYou can:\n\n    Select where the new bookmarks will be added\n    Choose to add the new bookmarks to the top or the bottom of the selected folder\n    Choose to add the new bookmarks to the last used folder (by any bookmarking or sorting method)\n    Select where the new folders of bookmarked tabs will be added (when bookmarking multiple selected tabs or using \"Bookmark All Tabs...\")\n    Choose to add the new folders of bookmarked tabs to the top or the bottom of the selected folder\n    Choose to add the new folders of bookmarked tabs to the last used folder (by any bookmarking or sorting method)\n\n\nQuick bookmark icon:\n\nThis feature will add a quick bookmark icon in the address bar, to (un)bookmark a page with only one click.\nThe icon is a round star icon in the address bar.\nIf the current page is bookmarked, the icon color will change to red.\n\nYou can:\n\n    Enable the quick bookmark shortcut (Alt+Shift+D)\n    Select where the new bookmarks will be added\n    Choose to add the new bookmarks to the top or the bottom of the selected folder\n    Choose to add the new bookmarks to the last used folder (by any bookmarking or sorting method)\n    Choose to show the page as bookmarked (i.e. the icon color changes) only if all the bookmarks of this page are in the folder you selected\n    Select the color of the quick bookmark icon (among a list) when the current page is bookmarked (red by default)\n\n\nQuick bookmarking to folder:\n\nAccess this feature via the extension browser action (toolbar icon) or via its dedicated shortcut (Alt+Shift+M).\n\nIt will allow you to search and select a specific folder within your bookmarks to quickly bookmark the current page into it.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you want to report a bug or ask for a new feature, you can open an issue on GitHub.

Your private bookmarks are encrypted with your chosen password. This is not an online service, and you are in control of what data leaves your machine (if at all).\n\nWhen you unlock your private bookmarks, a new 'Private Bookmarks' folder appears under 'Other Bookmarks'. You can add/remove items to it and when ready, lock it. Whenever an item is added/removed, the contents of the folder are encrypted and stored on your machine. When locked, the folder itself is removed from your browser's bookmarks collection.\n\nBy default, Private Bookmarks can only be accessed when in private browsing (to help avoid accidents), however that can be changed via the options page.\n\nBe aware!\nThis extension is still in early development, so bugs are to be expected, and you should backup your bookmarks periodically to be safe. Also, since I am bound by Firefox regarding what it allows extensions to do, I cannot guarantee complete privacy. Mobile versions of Firefox are not supported because they do not yet allow extensions access to your bookmarks the way desktop versions do.\n\nA note for Firefox Sync users\nRefrain from switching between devices while your private bookmarks are unlocked. Although personally I wasn't able to reproduce, there have been some reports of Sync getting confused and it may result in a copy of the folder remaining visible on other devices. I recommend unlocking, using, and locking all on the same device. If you encounter these issues, I also advise to trigger a sync from the Firefox menu after every lock so that you're sure the deletion of the folder goes through to your other devices. Sorry about the inconvenience.\n\nCustom folder location and name\nYou can move/rename the folder, and the next time you unlock it will appear in that location and with that name.\n\nAuto-locking\nThere are a few cases where the extension auto locks your private bookmarks:\n\n    If you have selected the \"disable outside of private browsing\" option (it is on by default) Private Bookmarks auto-locks when the last private window is closed.\n    If you have selected the \"auto-lock when idle\" option Private Bookmarks auto-locks once the system's been idle for a user-specified amount of time.\n    If you manually delete the Private Bookmarks folder.\n    If you close the browser while your private bookmarks are unlocked, the next time you open it the leftover Private Bookmarks folder is deleted immediately.\n\n\nBackup\nYou can export both encrypted/plain versions of your private bookmark data from within the options page. However, to import an encrypted backup file you must remember the password you used when that backup was made.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\nThe following shortcuts are available:\n\n    Alt+Shift+8 opens the menu in a new tab. If you have selected the \"disable outside of private browsing\" option (it is on by default) the tab will open in a private window.\n    Ctrl+Shift+8 adds the current page to your private bookmarks (requires unlocked bookmarks).\n    Ctrl+Shift+F8 adds all tabs in the current window to your private bookmarks (requires unlocked bookmarks).\n    Ctrl+Shift+L locks the folder (requires unlocked bookmarks).\n\n\nSomething's not working?

The Google Container extension helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Google.","fullDescription":"THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ADDON FROM MOZILLA! It is a fork of the Facebook Container addon.\n\nWhat does it do?\nGoogle Container works by isolating your Google identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Google to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension deletes your Google cookies and logs you out of Google.\nThe next time you navigate to Google it will load in a new red colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Google normally when in the Google Container. If you click on a non-Google link or navigate to a non-Google website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Google Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Google Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Google about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Google only in the Container, embedded Google comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Google Container will not work. This prevents Google from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Google to your Google identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Google credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Google use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Google Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Google from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Google still will have access to everything that you do while you are on google.com.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Google tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Google activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Google settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWe do never collect any data, all the data we see, you see.\n\nOther Containers\nGoogle Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Google Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. You should also check out Temporary Containers .\n\nNOTE: If you are a Firefox Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Google to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Google Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign google.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nRecommended privacy enhancing Add-ons\n\n    Decentraleyes:  Protects you against tracking through “free”, centralized, content delivery by automatically injecting local resources if possible.\n    Don’t track me google : If your search-engine of choice happens to be Google this Add-on will remove the tracking automatically placed on result-links. Or just use startpage.com instead.\n    HTTPS Everywhere:  Automatically redirects you to the secure version of websites if available.\n    Request Control: Lets you filter session, ref, utm and more query parameters from URLs and can also circumvent outgoing trackers on websites\n    uBlock Origin  I guess you already know this one. If not, check it out.","weeklyDownloads":952,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Perflyst","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13787351/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.3036,"reviewCount":49,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-container/reviews/","updateDate":1566569110000},{"id":"{28d1ed97-5ff6-432b-a26d-61896fe2cbed}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/849/849852-32.png?modified=1540238870","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/849/849852-64.png?modified=1540238870","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/849/849852-128.png?modified=1540238870"},"name":"Make Medium Readable Again","version":"1.5.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1119197/make_medium_readable_again-1.5.2-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://makemediumreadable.com","supportURL":"https://github.com/thebaer/MMRA/issues","description":"Improves the Medium reading experience, ruined by user engagement tactics.","fullDescription":"Medium is pretty annoying to read when you're not logged in.
